          Having your company/organisation evaluated and profiled on the
          Accessibility Compliance Dashboard (ACD) will stand you out as a
          disability-complaint organisation. It is hoped that inclusive and
          accessible companies/organisation&apos;s will receive certification
          in the future. Being a certified inclusive/accessible
          company/organisation is a testament to your organisation&apos;s
          inclusive policies and projects your company/organisation as one
          with a strong commitment towards an all-inclusive and sustainable
          Corporate Social Responsibility to the community you serve.
